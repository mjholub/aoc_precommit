A git pre-push hook for Advent of Code, that prevents pushing if the current repo
contains files that contain text representation of the current day of the month (in New York,
since this is the timezone that AOC uses).

I have created this project since I have, like probably most programmers, a habit to push my changes
frequently, but I want to remain fair in my participation.

Binaries for ~~Mac~~ (sorry, cross-compilation of Haskell to darwin-arm64 is not so simple, but I'll try to resolve this soon) and Linux are present in Releases.
